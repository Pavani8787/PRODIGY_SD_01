# PRODIGY_SD_01
A Python-based temperature conversion program that converts values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin


🌡️ PRODIGY_SD_01
🔁 Temperature Conversion Program
This project is a Python-based Temperature Conversion Program that converts temperatures between Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K) 🌍.
It helps users easily understand and perform temperature conversions using simple Python logic.
The program takes a temperature value and its unit as input from the user and then calculates the equivalent values in the remaining two temperature units automatically ⚙️.
🧠 How the Program Works
The user enters a numeric temperature value 🔢
The user specifies the temperature unit (C / F / K) 🅾️
The program checks the unit using conditional statements
Appropriate conversion formulas are applied ➗
Converted temperature values are displayed clearly 📊
✨ Features
🔄 Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
🧑‍💻 Takes user input dynamically
🧩 Uses simple if-elif-else logic
📘 Beginner-friendly and easy to understand
☁️ Runs smoothly in Google Colab and local Python environments
▶️ How to Run the Program
Clone the repository or download the Python file 📥
